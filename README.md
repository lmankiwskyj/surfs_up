- In June, the average temperature is almost 75 degrees, December averages only 71 degrees.
- In June, the highest temperature was 85 degrees, compared with December at 83 degrees.
- In June, the lowest temperature was 64 degrees, compared with December at 56 degrees.

## Summary
Looking at the results, the interquartile range for the temperatures in June is from 73 to 77 degrees, while December is 69 to 74 degrees. This is only a difference of 3-4 degrees and would seem optimal for a year-round surf and ice cream shop!

Next, we should consider reviewing the data for precipitation in June and December. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.
